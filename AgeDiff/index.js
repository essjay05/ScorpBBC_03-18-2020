// Challenge 1 of 3 (Easiest)
// Given Array of all fam members ages (all whole numbers... 5 months = 0 ) in ANY order
var ages = [];

// Return NEW array with [Youngest Age, Oldest Age, Age difference btw Oldest & youngest]

// Pseudocode:
    // Step one, create a new array to put in numbers we've found
    var ageDiff = [];

    // Find Youngest age and push into ageDiff / new array

    // Find Oldest age and push into ageDiff / new array

    // Subtract Oldest from Youngest age and push into ageDiff / new Array

    
// Solution:
function differenceInAges(ages) {
    // Your code goes here
}
